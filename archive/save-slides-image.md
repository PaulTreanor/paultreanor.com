# How to download images from Google Slides  🏞


Not sure why Google didn’t include an option to download images directly from Slides, this is a reasonably fast work around. This only works for images that are hosted on Google Drive, so images that you've uploaded yourself to the slide show. 




1. Right click on image in slides and select “Save to Keep”. 

<img src="/slides1.png" alt="Select save to keep">

2. Open your most recent note in [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/), right click on the image and select “Open Image In New Tab”.

3. Right click on image in new tab and save the image.
