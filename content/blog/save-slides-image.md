# How to download an image from Google Slides  🏞


Not sure why Google didn’t include an option to download images directly from Slides, this is a pretty fast work around. 

### 1. Save the image to Google Keep

Right click on image in slides and select “Save to Keep”. 

<img src="/slides1.png" alt="Select save to keep">

### 2. Open the image in a new tab from Google Keep

Open your most recent note in [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/), right click on the image and select “Open Image In New Tab”.
