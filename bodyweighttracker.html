<p>I made a webapp for tracking my bodyweight at <a href="www.bodyweighttracker.com/">bodyweighttracker.com</a>. It's not  special or interesting in anyway except that it doesn't have ads or a bloated feature set.</p>
<p>This was my first time exploring AWS CDK and even though this was a small project it's just so clear to me that there's no reason to use AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework anymore. CDK is just a much nicer experience and I suspect the gap would be even bigger with a more complex project.</p>
<p>I've also been really impressed with ShadCN/UI. I used it before with <a href="https://www.urltodo.com">urltodo</a> and it was a no brainer for this project. ShadCN is the best approach to adding components to a codebase I've seen so far.</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"bodyweighttracker","contentHtml":"\u003ch2\u003ebodyweighttracker.com, AWS CDK, and ShadCN/UI thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a webapp for tracking my bodyweight at \u003ca href=\"www.bodyweighttracker.com/\"\u003ebodyweighttracker.com\u003c/a\u003e.
