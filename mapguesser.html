<p>I made <a href="http://mapguesser.com">MapGuesser</a>, a GeoGuessr inspired geography game. It's pretty simple but I'm pretty proud of what I got done and people seem to be having fun with it 🎉</p>
<p>I was hoping to create a good multiplayer experience like <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> but my free time just disappeared so I decided to release my frontend only version as is. Time and creativity are pretty seasonal so you just have to embrace that 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed making a game though, it definitely won't be my last one, and being able to ship something just for myself <a href="https://www.swyx.io/part-time-creator-manifesto">while working a full time job with a pretty sizeable commute</a> has been incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">map API service</a> I used ends up tipping over the free tier I'll probably take a few days off my day job to try to limit page reloads and add some sort of paid tier, but otherwise I'm happy to call this project finished.
<br>
Please give the game a go and share it with your friends if you liked it :)</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"mapguesser","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003e🌎 MapGuesser.com\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made \u003ca href=\"http://mapguesser.com\"\u003eMapGuesser\u003c/a\u003e, a GeoGuessr inspired geography game.
