<p>I did a talk at a BelfastJS meetup a while back called "Power Tools for Digital DIYers". I didn't post it anywhere because I don't have a great recording of it, but I did make a cool demo for the talk, so I might as well share it.</p>
<p><a href="https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/">Here it is!</a> It's a note-taking app that you can programming like Excel. I called it NotesWorkShop. <strong>It's very very rough around the edges</strong> but I am very proud of the idea</p>
<h2>How do you use it.</h2>
<p>It's a markdown editor with an editing pane on the left and a live preview on the right, similar to how you edit markdown in VSCode.
The interesting part it that <strong>you can write your own rules that are applied to the rendered markdown</strong>.</p>
<p>Users can create conditional rules that apply effects to the rendered markdown. So for example a user could make the following rule: If a line contains the words "important", "urgent", or "ASAP" (<em>this is the condition</em>) then that line should be bold (<em>this is the effect</em>). The demo is simple but I think it has enough options for conditions and effects to get the idea across.</p>
<p>It's basically <strong>a human readable DSL that's programmed via UI elements</strong> like dropdowns and buttons. This feels way more accessible than end user programming tools like Excel or AutoHotKey which are basically just programming languages.</p>
<p>The only issue is I haven't been able to think of a use case that's compelling enough for me to build the idea out ü§î.</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"notesworkshop","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eA note-taking app that you can program like Excel...\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a talk at a BelfastJS meetup a while back called \"Power Tools for Digital DIYers\".
