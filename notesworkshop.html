<p>A few weeks ago I gave a talk called ""Power Tools for Digital DIYers" at a BelfastJS meetup. I didn't post it anywhere because I don't have a great recording of it, but I as part of the talk I made a cool demo, so I figured I'd share it here.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/">So here it is!</a></strong> - it's very rough around the edges and not really usable on mobile, but it works as a proof of concept: It's a note-taking app that you can program like Excel.</p>
<h2>How you use it</h2>
<p>It's a markdown editor with an editing pane on the left and a live preview on the right, similar to how you edit markdown in VSCode.
The interesting part it that <strong>you can write your own rules that are applied to the rendered markdown</strong>. Rules apply effects to the text when the user's conditions are met.</p>
<p>So for example a user could make the following rule: If a line contains the words "important", "urgent", or "ASAP" (<em>this is the condition</em>) then that line should be bold (<em>this is the effect</em>). The demo only has a handful of built in conditions and effects, but you can imagine a more fully featured version.</p>
<p>It's basically <strong>a human readable DSL that's programmed via UI elements</strong> like dropdowns and buttons. This feels way more accessible than something like excel which is basically just a programming language, but also more flexible than Notion.</p>
<p>The only issue is I haven't been able to think of a use case that's compelling enough for me to build the idea out ü§î.</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"notesworkshop","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eA note-taking app that you can program like Excel...\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks ago I gave a talk called \"\"Power Tools for Digital DIYers\" at a BelfastJS meetup.
