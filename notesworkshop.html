<p>I made a demo for <a href="https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/">a notes taking app that you can program like excel</a>. It's very rough around the edges and not really usable on mobile, but it gets the idea across.</p>
<h2>How you use it</h2>
<p>You write markdown in the left pane, and there's a live preview on the right, just like how you edit markdown in VSCode. There interesting part is that <strong>you can write your own rules that are applied to the rendered markdown</strong>. These rules are basically combinations of <em>conditions</em> that apply <em>effects</em> when met.</p>
<p>So for example here's a rule a user could make: If a line contains the words "important", "urgent", or "ASAP" (<em>this is the condition</em>) then that line should be bold (<em>this is the effect</em>).</p>
<p>The demo only has a handful of built in conditions and effects, but you can imagine a more fully featured version.</p>
<p>It's basically <strong>a human readable DSL that's programmed via UI elements</strong> like dropdowns and buttons instead of code. This feels like a nice middle ground for making end user programming tools powerful yet accessible compared to Excel (which is hard to learn) and Notion (which is easier to learn but isn't very flexible).</p>
<p>The only issue is I haven't been able to think of a use case that's compelling enough for me to build the idea out ü§î.</p></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"notesworkshop","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eA note-taking app that you can program like Excel...\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a demo for \u003ca href=\"https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/\"\u003ea notes taking app that you can program like excel\u003c/a\u003e.
