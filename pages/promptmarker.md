# ðŸ”– PromptMarker

**Update November 2024**: *I'm retiring this project because I pretty much never use ChatGPT since Claude Sonnet 3.5 game out. Since then OpenAI has made some small changes to the ChatGPT UI so some PromptMarker features no longer work and I see no need to update the application anymore.*

I made a ChatGPT MacOS app called PromptMarker which lets you save prompts and quickly switch between them. You can download the app at [Gumroad](https://paultreanor.gumroad.com/l/promptmarker).

### Why I made PromptMarker 
I made the app to remove some friction I had while using the ChatGPT webapp: 
- Desktop apps are easier to find and [alt-tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) to when you're working on multiple things at once
- EU users didn't have access to [custom instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt) when I started making this
- I find myself retyping similar prompts a lot

I'm reasonably happy with how PromptMarker solves these problems. 

### How I use the app
If I find myself typing some sort of pre-prompt context more than once, I'll save it to the sidebar. This is specifically pretty useful when for programming, I don't have to retype an explanation that I'm using React, electron-store, and TailwindCSS (for example) before asking it to write me a component - I can just click on the sidebar instead.
