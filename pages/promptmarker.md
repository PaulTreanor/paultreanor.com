# ðŸ”– PromptMarker

I made a ChatGPT MacOS app called PromptMarker which lets you save prompts and quickly switch between them. You can download the app at [Gumroad](https://paultreanor.gumroad.com/l/promptmarker).

### Why I made PromptMarker 
I made the app to remove some friction I had while using the ChatGPT webapp: 
- Desktop apps are easier to find and [alt-tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) to when you're working on multiple things at once
- EU users didn't have access to [custom instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt) when I started making this
- I find myself retyping similar prompts a lot

I'm reasonably happy with how PromptMarker solves these problems. 

### How I use the app
If I find myself typing some sort of pre-prompt context more than once, I'll save it to the sidebar. This is specifically pretty useful when for programming, I don't have to retype an explanation that I'm using `react`, `electron-store`, and `tailwindCSS` (for example) before asking it to write me a component - I can just click on the sidebar instead. 

### Some specific prompts I like:
**Be brief**
"Answer my question briefly:"

**Writing review** (this is absurdly useful)
"Can you give me some feedback on my full article. I want to know if there are any spelling mistakes, awkward sentence, "bad takes"/"cringe", or if there's any general areas that could be improved upon? I'd like your feedback in the form of a list of items."
