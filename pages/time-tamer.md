# ü¶Å Time Tamer 

I made a time management app for MacOs called Time Tamer. It's essentially a very simple minimal version of [Toggl](https://toggl.com/). You can download it [here as a GitHub release](https://github.com/PaulTreanor/time-tamer/releases/tag/v1.0).

It's not groundbreaking, but it's good enough for me to use it everyday. I'm not finished with it either, there's still a few little fixes I'd like to address...

- Display the app's timer status in the menu bar
- Pressing `Enter` key while typing adds task to list
- Delete button to deleted existing tasks
- Edit button to edit existing tasks
- Releases for windows and linux

### Why I made it 
I've found that <span class="font-bold"> I work better if I time myself while I work</span>. It makes focusing hard feel like a game, while also holding me accountable, so I feel bad if I piss about too much. 

Until recently I just played these [1 hour YouTube LoFi compilations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTRiuFIWV54) while I worked and counted the number of videos up to track how long I work. Time Tamer is my attempt at making a slightly more elegant tool for the job. 

### Suggestion on how to use Time Tamer 
I like these <span class="italic">meta<span> work tools, but they only work if you take them seriously. If you start cheating then the timer loses all it's motivational powers.

- <span class="font-bold">I only track things *while* I'm actually working on them</span>. If I leave my desk or open Twitter, I pause the timer.  

- I also <span class="font-bold">only track real work</span> (stuff I'm getting paid to do). This way I can be sure that the *total time* at the end of each day is a source of truth.  

- I set goals every morning for how many hours of focused work I'll try to get done.
