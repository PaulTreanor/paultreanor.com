## Tiny Calendar

 
I built a browser extension that lets you easily open dates in Google Calendar. 

I use Google Calendar a lot, but it's clunky for checking dates far ahead (e.g. do I have plans on January 30th? What day of the week is Christmas this year?). **TinyCalendar** makes it easy with a simple date picker that quickly opens the selected week in Google Calendar.
