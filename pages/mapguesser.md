# 🌎 MapGuesser.com

I made [MapGuesser](http://mapguesser.com), a GeoGuessr inspired geography game. It's pretty simple but I'm pretty proud of what I got done and people seem to be having fun with it 🎉

 I was hoping to create a good multiplayer experience like [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) but my free time just disappeared so I decided to release my frontend only version as is. Time and creativity are pretty seasonal so you just have to embrace that 🤷‍♂️.

I really enjoyed making a game though, it definitely won't be my last one, and being able to ship something just for myself [while working a full time job with a pretty sizeable commute](https://www.swyx.io/part-time-creator-manifesto) has been incredibly rewarding. 

If the [map API service](https://www.mapbox.com/) I used ends up tipping over the free tier I'll probably take a few days off my day job to try to limit page reloads and add some sort of paid tier, but otherwise I'm happy to call this project finished.

Please give the game a go and share it with your friends if you liked it :)
