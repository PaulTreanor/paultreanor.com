I'm building <a href="https://spacedaws.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpacedAWS</a>, a spaced repetition powered flashcard app to help users pass their AWS certifications. SpacedAWS isn't my main focus, this is a marathon not a sprint. Here is my project devlog:</i>

### 19/1/24 - Why SpacedAWS? & current development status

Udemy courses are a bad way to study enormous amounts of technical information. You have to learn at the video's pace (too fast or too slow), and the content doesn't adapt to the users' learning needs. The AWS courses are boring 40 hour slogs and searching for specific content within them is too difficult. 

A flashcard based course with a smart algorithm and a pleasant user experience solves these problems. Of course there's anki, but the decks are low quality and the platform is hostile to use. 

SpacedAWS will be the best way to study for AWS Certifications. 


**Current development status**

I've been gradually developing this idea since November. So far, I've completed the DNS/frontend deployment, frontend CI/CD, a landing page, courses and flashcard UI, an email collection service, authentication, and a basic question-answering flow. 

Here's a screenshot of some of the work:

I'm a few months away from an MVP as this is a nights and weekend project. I still need to develop and integrate the course content, build the user progress tracking system, build the question delivery system, build the payments system, and then make sure all that stuff's glued together right.

How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.
