# ðŸ“… Obsidian Notes Dater 

I made an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that adds the dates that the current note (or any file opened in your vault) was created on and last updated on to the status bar. 

It's weird that Obsidian doesn't ship with this, but I appreciate that they make it so easy to add plugins for little improvements like these. 

[Here's the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PaulTreanor/notes-dater). You can [click here to open the plugin in Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=notes-dater) if it's on your computer.
