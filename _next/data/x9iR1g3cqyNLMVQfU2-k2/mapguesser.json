{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"mapguesser","contentHtml":"<h1>🌎 MapGuesser.com</h1>\n<p>I made <a href=\"http://mapguesser.com\">MapGuesser</a>, a GeoGuessr inspired geography game. It's pretty simple but I'm pretty proud of what I got done and people seem to be having with it 🎉</p>\n<p>I was hoping to create a good multiplayer experience like <a href=\"https://skribbl.io/\">skribbl.io</a> but my free time just disappeared so I decided to release my frontend only version as is. Time and creativity are pretty seasonal so you just have to embrace that 🤷‍♂️.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed making a game though, it definitely won't be my last one, and being able to ship something just for myself <a href=\"https://www.swyx.io/part-time-creator-manifesto\">while working a full time job with a pretty sizeable commute</a> has been incredibly rewarding.</p>\n<p>If the <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\">map API service</a> I used ends up tipping over the free tier I'll probably take a few days off my day job to try to limit page reloads and add some sort of paid tier, but otherwise I'm happy to call this project finished.\n<br>\nPlease give the game a go and share it with your friends if you liked it :)</p>","title":"🌎 MapGuesser.com","short":"I created a browser game for geography lovers.","date":"2024-07-21","slug":"mapguesser","createdAt":"2023-07-21","img":"blog-2.jpg","tags":["Release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
