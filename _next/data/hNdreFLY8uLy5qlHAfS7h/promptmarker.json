{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"promptmarker","contentHtml":"<h1>ðŸ”– PromptMarker</h1>\n<p>I made a ChatGPT MacOS app called PromptMarker which lets you save prompts and quickly switch between them. You can download the app at <a href=\"https://paultreanor.gumroad.com/l/promptmarker\">Gumroad</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/promptmarker/screenshot.png\" alt=\"PromptMarker\">\n<h3>Why I made PromptMarker</h3>\n<p>I made the app to remove some friction I had while using the ChatGPT webapp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desktop apps are easier to find and <a href=\"https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/\">alt-tab</a> to when you're working on multiple things at once</li>\n<li>EU users didn't have access to <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt\">custom instructions</a> when I started making this</li>\n<li>I find myself retyping similar prompts a lot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm reasonably happy with how PromptMarker solves these problems.</p>\n<h3>How I use the app</h3>\n<p>If I find myself typing some sort of pre-prompt context more than once, I'll save it to the sidebar. This is specifically pretty useful when for programming, I don't have to retype an explanation that I'm using <code class=\"inline-code-custom-style\">react</code>, <code class=\"inline-code-custom-style\">electron-store</code>, and <code class=\"inline-code-custom-style\">tailwindCSS</code> (for example) before asking it to write me a component - I can just click on the sidebar instead.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://paultreanor.gumroad.com/l/promptmarker\">Download the app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PaulTreanor/PromptMarker\">GitHub Repo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhWOcMSWHvY\">View a video demo on YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>Shoot me an email if you'd like to give me some feedback on the app or make a feature request ðŸ¤”</p>","title":"ðŸ”– PromptMarker","short":"ChatGPT desktop prompt bookingmarking app","date":"2023-09-04","slug":"promptmarker","createdAt":"2023-09-04","img":"blog-2.jpg","tags":["Release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
