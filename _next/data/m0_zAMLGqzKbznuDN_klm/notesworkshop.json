{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"notesworkshop","contentHtml":"<h1>A note-taking app that you can program like Excel...</h1>\n<p>I did a talk at a BelfastJS meetup a while back called \"Power Tools for Digital DIYers\". I didn't post it anywhere because I don't have a great recording of it, but I did make a cool demo for the talk, so I might as well share it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/\">Here it is!</a> It's a note-taking app that you can programming like Excel. I called it NotesWorkShop. <strong>It's very very rough around the edges</strong> but I am very proud of the idea</p>\n<h2>How do you use it.</h2>\n<p>It's a markdown editor with an editing pane on the left and a live preview on the right, similar to how you edit markdown in VSCode.\nThe interesting part it that <strong>you can write your own rules that are applied to the rendered markdown</strong>.</p>\n<p>Users can create conditional rules that apply effects to the rendered markdown. So for example a user could make the following rule: If a line contains the words \"important\", \"urgent\", or \"ASAP\" (<em>this is the condition</em>) then that line should be bold (<em>this is the effect</em>). The demo is simple but I think it has enough options for conditions and effects to get the idea across.</p>\n<p>It's basically <strong>a human readable DSL that's programmed via UI elements</strong> like dropdowns and buttons. This feels way more accessible than end user programming tools like Excel or AutoHotKey which are basically just programming languages.</p>\n<p>The only issue is I haven't been able to think of a use case that's compelling enough for me to build the idea out ðŸ¤”.</p>","title":"A note-taking app that you can program like Excel...","short":"A demo of a note-taking app that you can program like Excel","date":"2024-10-11","slug":"notesworkshop","createdAt":"2024-10-11","img":"blog-2.jpg","tags":["Note"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
