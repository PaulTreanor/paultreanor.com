{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"notesworkshop","contentHtml":"<h1>A note-taking app that you can program like Excel...</h1>\n<p>A few weeks ago I gave a talk called \"\"Power Tools for Digital DIYers\" at a BelfastJS meetup. I didn't post it anywhere because I don't have a great recording of it, but I as part of the talk I made a cool demo, so I figured I'd share it here.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://notesworkshop.vercel.app/\">So here it is!</a></strong> - it's very rough around the edges and not really usable on mobile, but it works as a proof of concept: It's a note-taking app that you can program like Excel.</p>\n<h2>How you use it</h2>\n<p>It's a markdown editor with an editing pane on the left and a live preview on the right, similar to how you edit markdown in VSCode.\nThe interesting part it that <strong>you can write your own rules that are applied to the rendered markdown</strong>. Rules apply effects to the text when the user's conditions are met.</p>\n<p>So for example a user could make the following rule: If a line contains the words \"important\", \"urgent\", or \"ASAP\" (<em>this is the condition</em>) then that line should be bold (<em>this is the effect</em>). The demo only has a handful of built in conditions and effects, but you can imagine a more fully featured version.</p>\n<p>It's basically <strong>a human readable DSL that's programmed via UI elements</strong> like dropdowns and buttons. This feels way more accessible than something like excel which is basically just a programming language, but also more flexible than Notion.</p>\n<p>The only issue is I haven't been able to think of a use case that's compelling enough for me to build the idea out ðŸ¤”.</p>","title":"A note-taking app that you can program like Excel...","short":"A demo of a note-taking app that you can program like Excel","date":"2024-10-11","slug":"notesworkshop","createdAt":"2024-10-11","img":"blog-2.jpg","tags":["Note"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
