It's not  special or interesting in anyway except that it doesn't have ads or a bloated feature set.</p>\n<p>This was my first time exploring AWS CDK and even though this was a small project it's just so clear to me that there's no reason to use AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework anymore. CDK is just a much nicer experience and I suspect the gap would be even bigger with a more complex project.</p>\n<p>I've also been really impressed with ShadCN/UI. I used it before with <a href=\"https://www.urltodo.com\">urltodo</a> and it was a no brainer for this project. ShadCN is the best approach to adding components to a codebase I've seen so far.</p>","title":"bodyweighttracker.com, AWS CDK, and ShadCN/UI thoughts","short":"A boring bodyweight tracking app and some thoughts on cloud and frontend tooling","date":"2025-05-01","slug":"bodyweighttracker","createdAt":"2025-05-01","img":"blog-2.jpg","tags":["Release"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
