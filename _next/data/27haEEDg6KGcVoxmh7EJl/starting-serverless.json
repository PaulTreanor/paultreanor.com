The project uses React, but the important bits are explained clearly enough to be followed along with any frontend framework. The guide even sets up a billing system with the Stripe API, making it a great way to prototype a potential business project very quickly.</p>\n<p>Serverless Stack also provides fantastic standalone pages that explain some of the more confusing ideas in serverless applications, like <a href=\"https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/what-is-iam.html\">IAM Roles</a>, <a href=\"https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/cognito-user-pool-vs-identity-pool.html\">Cognito user and identity pools</a>, and <a href=\"https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/stages-in-serverless-framework.html\">stages</a>.</p>\n<h2>Complete Coding</h2>\n<p>There's not much to say here except that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uBP0Un18DJAnWjm1CPqBg\">Complete Coding</a> has the best Serverless AWS tutorials on the internet.</p>\n<p>The videos are concise, use best practices, and usually come with a git repo in the description which is very helpful. Complete coding is always the first place I go to when I need to refresh my understanding of anything AWS or Serverless.</p>\n<h2>SLIC Starter</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fourtheorem/slic-starter\">SLIC Starter</a> is a checklist application that can be used to bootstrap any serverless project.</p>\n<p>While Serverless Stack's guide sets up some services such as cognito through the AWS console, SLIC is configured entirely by code. By using this \"Infrastructure-as-Code\" approach, the project can easily be version controlled, deleted, or deployed on another AWS account.</p>\n<p>I find that SLIC is a great resource for seeing how certain best practices should be done in a serverless way:</p>\n<ol class=\"pl-5\">\n  <li>Define resources as code (not in the console)</li>\n  <li>Separate resources and functions</li>\n  <li>Build systems from <a href=\"https://www.fourtheorem.com/blog/monorepo\">smaller loosely coupled services</a></li>\n  <li>Fully automate the CICD pipeline</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SLIC starter was created by the team at fourTheorem and it's open source so contributions are welcome by everyone! ðŸ˜Š</p>","title":"Starting with AWS and the Serverless Framework","short":"The best learning resources for getting started with serverless.","createdAt":"2021-09-21","date":"2021-09-21","slug":"starting-serverless","tags":["Work","Code"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
